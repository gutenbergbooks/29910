to Mars with surprising results.</b></big></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="scap">Crawford completed</span> the rehearsal
in less than an hour. He
listened to the orchestra run
through its selections, okayed the
song the guest vocalist had
chosen, then finished up with a
long dialogue between Spud and
himself. When it was over he
checked timing with the program
director, made a few script
changes and conferred briefly with
a Special Service Officer about
the number of troops the auditorium
could hold. Everything
was running smoothly. It was
going to be a neat, action-packed
show.</p>

<p>Backstage he looked at his
watch. He had almost two hours
before the regular show began and
he was restless. Two hours at
Harlow Field could seem like two
years. Guards and restrictions
all over the place.</p>

<p>Harlow Field was the largest
experimental base in the world, a
veritable garden of atoms, the
proving grounds for every secret
weapon ever imagined. The
security and the tight regulations
gave Crawford the jitters on each
of his visits.</p>

<p>He smoked a cigarette and
tried making small talk with some
of the soldiers on backstage detail.
He posed for a picture and
gave an interview to a reporter
from an army newspaper, then
excused himself and went to his
dressing room with Spud propped
in the crook of his arm.</p>

<p>He was used to it now; the
applause, the audiences, the pictures,
the autographs, the fuss.
Everywhere the response was the
same. They had either seen him
in the movies or on television or
in the nightclubs, where he first
broke in his act. Now they wanted
to establish an identity with him,
to touch the merchandise, to stand
close so that they could write
home about the visiting celebrity.
Crawford was a realist. It was all
part of being a name.</p>

<p>It had taken him just five years
to make the big time. Five years
of road shows, coast-to-coast
tours, one-night stands and a
dummy named Spud to make him
the hottest ventriloquist in the
business. His act was tight, well-paced
and popular. He had a
weekly radio show, a television
program and a seven-year contract
with a major Hollywood
studio. He was riding high.</p>

<p>Still he hadn't forgotten the
soldiers. Two months each year
he took time off to travel the
USO circuit. His agent tore his
hair, reminding him of the
financial losses, but the USO had
given him his first break so he
had always answered their call.
He liked enthusiastic audiences
and the cheering of laugh-hungry
men made him happy. Entertainment
was his business and he
enjoyed exhibiting his talent. The
wider the audience the better he
liked it.</p>

<p>His dressing room was located
back of the auditorium. He closed
the door behind him, put Spud on
a chair and began getting out of
his rehearsal clothes. He lit a
cigarette and looked at himself
in the mirror. He was tired and
needed a shave. In the last week
the pace had been fast. The USO
tour still had a few days to run,
but he was looking forward to its
end. A vacation, the luxury of
relaxation would all be his then.</p>

<p>He opened a drawer of the
dressing table and pulled out a
bottle of Scotch. There were two
hours to be killed before the
show. He drank a shot and
thought about it. A shower, a
shave, a good dinner and a walk
around the base would consume
the time. After the show he would
drive back to town and check in
at a hotel for a good night's sleep.</p>

<p>He was putting the bottle back
in the drawer when a knock
sounded on the door. He said
"Come in," thinking it was one
of the cast and didn't turn around.
He heard the door open, glanced
into the mirror and glimpsed
Colonel Meadows, the Commanding
Officer of Harlow Field, and
a man in civilian clothes he didn't
recognize. He turned around,
reached for a bathrobe.</p>

<p>"Don't mind us, Robbie," said
the Colonel. "Just dropped by to
say hello." He was a small,
plump man and his face was always
red and perspiring. Crawford
knew him slightly from the
other two times he had played
Harlow Field, but this was the
first time the Colonel had ever
paid him a backstage visit.</p>

<p>"Got a fan here who wants to
meet you," continued the Colonel.
"Shake hands with Dr. Paul Shalt,
one of our base scientists. He and
I just caught your rehearsal. Fine,
very fine."</p>

<p>The doctor's name struck a
chord and Crawford dug deep
until it focused. Dr. Paul Shalt
was a physicist working with the
army. He specialized in the development
of radar, was the chief
developer of the electrical detonator
used in atomic bombs.</p>

<p>"I enjoyed your performance
very much," said Dr. Shalt. "Your
voice is extraordinary." He had
a smooth, angular face, black
hair and black, penetrating eyes.
"Amazing range."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Crawford.</p>

<p>"And the clearness of tone is
phenomenal," said Dr. Shalt.
"Has it always been like that?"</p>

<p>Crawford nodded. "When I
was a kid it embarrassed me, my
voice," he said, smiling. "A trick
voice, everybody called it. But
it's a definite asset to a practitioner
of the art of ventriloquism."</p>

<p>"You should have seen Dr.
Shalt while you were on stage,"
said Colonel Meadows, beaming
at him. "He was running all over
the auditorium testing your voice
with one of his gadgets."</p>

<hr />

<p>Crawford grinned. "I didn't
realize I moved my audience so."</p>

<p>Dr. Shalt laughed. "What
Colonel Meadows says is true.
I'm <i>very</i> interested in your vocal
range. While you rehearsed I
tested the quality and sound of
your tone." He stopped, looked
around the room until he discovered
Spud where Crawford
had put him on the chair. He
walked over to the dummy and
touched the wooden head with his
hand.</p>

<p>"Actually it's a <i>second voice</i>,
that sound and vibration you use
for Spud. It's perfect, perfect for
what I need, that second voice."</p>

<p>Dr. Shalt put the dummy back
in the position he had found him
in, reached into his pocket and
brought out a small glass-enclosed
instrument which he held in front
of him.</p>

<p>"Do you know what this is?"
he asked, approaching the dressing
table.</p>

<p>"Never saw it before," Crawford
said, examining the gadget.
A small arrow flickered nervously
within a glass cage.</p>

<p>"It's called a Voice Oscillator,"
explained Dr. Shalt. "It's sensitive
to the slightest tonal inflection.
We use it to measure the
pitch and volume of a human
voice."</p>

<p>"What's all this got to do with
me?" Crawford asked.</p>

<p>"This&mdash;we want to use the
voice of Spud for an experiment.
A very important experiment.
With your permission, we'd like
to do it immediately."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that's impossible,"
said Crawford. "I have a show
in about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Our equipment is all set up,"
interrupted the doctor. "The
entire test will take forty-five
minutes. We'll have you back in
no time."</p>

<p>Crawford frowned. He was
tired and he'd looked forward to
relaxing a while before the show.
"Couldn't we make it some other
time," he said.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Colonel spoke then. "Robbie,
do you remember reading
four years ago that our radar
system was able to beam signals
to the moon and have them returned?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Crawford. "It got
a big play in all the newspapers."</p>

<p>"Well, our scientists are now
ready to conduct a similar experiment,"
said Colonel Meadows.
"This time to Mars."</p>

<p>"To Mars!" repeated Crawford,
wondering what it had to do with
him.</p>

<p>"Only this time we plan to send
a <i>voice</i>, a human voice that can
travel through interstellar space,"
said Dr. Shalt.</p>

<p>"But that's impossible!" Crawford
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"With the average voice, yes,"
said Dr. Shalt. "Cosmic disturbances
would drown out a normal
voice amplified a thousand times
beyond its regular frequency. But
a voice in a higher octave&mdash;like
your second voice ... Well, we
believe there's a certain resonant
intonation which can be curved
and regulated in any direction,
in the voice you use for your
dummy."</p>

<p>Crawford nodded.</p>

<p>"Spud's voice contains that
quality," continued Dr. Shalt. "I
believe it can reach Mars and
bounce back. I'm asking you to
be the first man ever to throw his
voice to another planet."</p>

<p>There was quiet for a moment
when he finished. Crawford's
cigarette had gone out and he
relit it. The smoke steadied him.
Outside, in the auditorium the
orchestra had begun to rehearse
again.</p>

<p>"Where's the station set-up?"
asked Crawford finally.</p>

<p>"It's right here on the field,
Robbie," Colonel Meadows said
quickly. "We've had it under
wraps for the last eight months.
It'll be a tremendous thing if it
works."</p>

<p>Crawford dragged on his
cigarette a last time and stamped
it out. He walked over to Spud,
lifted the dummy into position in
the crook of his arm.</p>

<p>"What do you say, Crawford?"
asked Dr. Shalt. There was a note
of urgency in his voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Crawford
slowly. "My crazy voice is my
bread and butter. Can't you use
somebody else? Somebody whose
voice isn't his life?"</p>

<p>"We've wasted weeks testing
every man on this field," said Dr.
Shalt solemnly. "The average
voice becomes static as soon as
it gets past Earth's atmosphere.
But your voice can break through.
I've studied every vibration, every
quiver of it. It bends and flexes
with each cosmic pressure. You
<i>must</i> let us try."</p>

<p>Crawford looked at Colonel
Meadows.</p>

<p>"Robbie, I promise you there's
no danger involved," the Colonel
said. "There's been a great deal
of time and effort put into this
project and we'd like to see it
work. This week Mars and Earth
are the closest they'll be for the
next three years, so it must be
done <i>now</i>. It's your duty to help
in this important project."</p>

<p>Crawford nodded. The matter
of patriotism and duty had not
occurred to him. "Of course,
Colonel, I'll be glad to help."</p>

<p>He looked down at the dummy.
"What do you say, Spud? Want
to be the first voice to reach
Mars?"</p>

<p>"Sounds crazy," came the high,
squeaking reply. "But it ought to
put us in the history books."
Spud's glass eyes shifted to the
other two men in the room and
one lid winked. "Calling Mars!
This is Spud O'Malley, old quiver
voice himself, coming in for a
landing."</p>

<p>"Good! You'll do it," said Dr.
Shalt excitedly. "And if we succeed
the publicity will be worldwide."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Crawford. "An
actor likes publicity. But are you
sure my voice won't be strained?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure," Dr. Shalt said.
"You'll be talking into a microphone
in the same tone you use
for a broadcast. Nothing more."</p>

<p>"How long will it take?" asked
Crawford.</p>

<p>Dr. Shalt checked his watch.
"Fifteen minutes for the voice to
reach Mars and fifteen minutes
for its return." He took out a
black notebook from his jacket
pocket and began to outline the
plan while Colonel Meadows put
through a call to the laboratory.</p>

<p>Spud's voice was to be relayed
directly to a giant amplifying unit
which would project it into space.
Those regulating the voice in the
control room would hear nothing
but vibrations because of the high
frequency it would immediately
attain while passing through. Only
on its return from Mars would
Spud's voice become audible on
Earth. It sounded fantastic but
Dr. Shalt spoke of it as if it were
a certainty and Crawford knew he
was recognized as a great scientist.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Colonel
Meadows hung up the phone.
He said excitedly, "Everything's
set. All the equipment is ready
and there's a command car waiting
outside."</p>

<p>Crawford caught a quick
glimpse of himself in the mirror.
No shower, no shave, no quiet
dinner, no walk; all that would
have to come later. He'd been
hooked. "I'm ready any time you
are," he said. He folded Spud
in his arms and followed the two
men to the door.</p>

<p>They did not speak much in
the car. The laboratory was on
the Northern rim of the field, a
ten-minute drive from the auditorium.
Approaching the building,
Crawford noticed the high
radar towers and the steel fences
surrounding its frame. They rode
past three different guard posts
and numerous military policemen
before the car halted at the main
entrance.</p>

<p>Immediately they were ushered
into a small broadcasting studio
which was soundproofed and
closed off by a heavy metal door.
This was Dr. Shalt's home
grounds and he took charge.</p>

<p>A microphone had been set up
and Dr. Shalt had Crawford test
Spud's voice while a technician
in the control booth measured it
acoustically. After an exact tone
had been determined for the amplification
unit, Dr. Shalt briefed
him on some details, patted him
on the back and disappeared into
the control booth followed by
Colonel Meadows.</p>

<p>Crawford lit another cigarette
and smoked nervously while he
awaited the go-ahead signal.
There was a dry tightness in his
throat and he concentrated on
relaxing his tension.</p>

<p>High on the studio wall a large
clock hacked away at the seconds,
and behind the glass fa&ccedil;ade of the
control booth he could see Dr.
Shalt and his assistant manipulating
dials on an intricate panel. It
was almost three minutes before
he heard another sound beside the
creak of his own impatient footsteps.
Then Dr. Shalt's voice
came on the feed-back, the
speaker system connecting the
studio with the booth.</p>

<p>"Crawford, talk into the mike
when we flash you the sign. Keep
talking for a minute. And remember&mdash;it's
just another broadcast.
Good luck."</p>

<p>Crawford nodded, deposited
the cigarette in an ashtray. He
moved into position and slid his
fingers along the inner wires of
Spud's back until they fitted into
place. Spud's head came alive.</p>

<p>Dr. Shalt brought his right hand
down in a long, sweeping motion.
A bright red bulb above the control
booth winked into life. Robbie
Crawford went into his act.</p>

<p>Inside the booth Dr. Shalt,
Colonel Meadows and a technician
watched Crawford performing
in pantomime and listened to
the strange vibrations emanating
from the speaker. They could distinguish
no understandable sound
for the amplifier had lifted the
voice beyond human hearing as it
released it to the stratosphere.
They sat quietly, content to wait
for the voice to return from its
long, lonely journey.</p>

<p>Crawford spoke until he saw
Dr. Shalt signal for a conclusion.
A moment later the red bulb
blinked out and the broadcast
was ended. Crawford felt cold
and his hands were perspiring
freely. He saw the beaming face
of Colonel Meadows motioning
him to come inside the booth. He
wiped his face, and coughed to
relieve the tension in his throat.</p>

<p>The Colonel was the first to
greet him as he entered the booth,
and his handshake was enthusiastic
and firm. Dr. Shalt remained
bent over one of the instrument
boards rotating a dial, but looked
up and nodded excitedly.</p>

<p>"It will be another ten minutes,"
he said. "Sit down. I've sent out
for some supper."</p>

<p>"How did it go?" Crawford
asked.</p>

<p>"Good! Good! By now it's half
way to its destination."</p>

<p>An orderly came in with a tray
of sandwiches and coffee and for
the next few minutes they ate and
Dr. Shalt described the intricacies
of the operation. The technician
stayed glued to the receiver, earphones
resting lightly across his
head.</p>

<p>After ten minutes Dr. Shalt
stood up and looked at his watch.
"It's time," he said. "Turn up the
resonator." He moved closer to
the receiving set as the others
gathered around him. The low
hum of the monitor signal became
louder as the technician
switched on a new lever. The
static emerging from the speaker
thickened, obliterating all other
noises. Another two minutes
went by....</p>

<p>Crawford watched it all, aware
of the tension and anxiety on each
face, feeling the throbbing excitement
himself. So they stood,
tensely expectant, awaiting the
return of his voice....</p>

<p>Suddenly the technician whispered,
"I've got it! It's coming! I
hear it returning!" He swung
around, offering his earphones to
Dr. Shalt, who grabbed for them
hurriedly. The scientist raised
the cups to his ear and waited.
The room fell into deeper silence.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, it's the voice! Turn
up the resonator to full volume!
We've got it! The voice is completing
the circuit!" Dr. Shalt said
tensely.</p>

<p>The technician turned another
dial as far as it would go. The
sound of the static rose to a roar.
Then abruptly the static broke,
died out and a strange new sound
came in. It was Spud! Spud's
voice creeping back from a trip
to Mars, thirty-five million miles
away!</p>

<p>"<i>Hello.... This is the voice of
Spud O'Malley. I speak to you
from Harlow Field in the United
States of America. My voice is
being sent to you by a newly invented
Amplification Unit developed
by Dr. Paul Shalt at this
experimental base. This is the
first time such an operation has
ever been tried. We extend our
heartiest greetings, our deepest
felicitations ...</i>"</p>

<p>It went on, the high, squeaking
voice, friendly, humorous, alive;
sending back to them the words
that Crawford had spoken into
the microphone a few minutes
before.</p>

<p>Crawford studied the faces of
the other men. They had worked
and planned a long time for this
single moment, the realization of
a long pursued dream. Colonel
Meadows was rubbing his hands
together gleefully. The voice was
reaching its climax. Success was
assured. History had been made!</p>

<p>There was a little silence as
Spud finished speaking. The technician
reached across leisurely
to shut off the resonator.</p>

<p>Suddenly the voice started
again. The technician's hand
froze in mid-air. The same high,
squeaking tone, the same inflections,
the same pitch. But
this time it was commanding, authoritative.</p>

<p>"<i>This is Mars. We have received
your voice. We know of
you, know your language. We
want you to know that we do not
like intruders. We want no contact
with you. Seek us out no
more. The voice was received
clearly. It fits our frequency well.
We will keep it so that no more
communication from you is possible.
Let this be a warning. Stay
away! We do not want you!</i>"</p>

<p>The voice stopped and there
was silence again. Then Colonel
Meadows chuckled. "Very clever,
Crawford! You really startled me
for a moment."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dr. Shalt, smiling.
"So you made a little joke at the
end. Very clever."</p>

<p>Crawford's back was to them
as he stared at the loudspeaker.
His face was contorted in a surprised
grimace and the flesh was
suddenly white and lifeless. He
turned to face them, his body
rigid and his mouth trembling as
he whispered:</p>

<p>"That voice&mdash;that last voice&mdash;it
wasn't mine! <i>That wasn't me
speaking!</i>"</p>

<p>Dr. Shalt laughed. "Superb
actor. A great performance, Mr.
Crawford. We are most grateful
to you."</p>

<p>"Robbie's a born comedian,"
added Colonel Meadows, his eyes
sparkling with the humor of the
situation. "Never misses a chance
to clown."</p>

<p>"Don't you understand&mdash;<i>it
wasn't my voice</i>!" screamed Crawford.
He looked from one man
to another, his eyes pleading for
belief. "The second part was not
mine!"</p>

<p>They stared at him, their smiles
fading.</p>

<p>Colonel Meadows said, "What
do you mean, Robbie?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear when I spoke?
I never said those last things.
Didn't you hear what I said?"</p>

<p>The technician answered him.
"We didn't hear a thing, Mr.
Crawford. The amplification was
too high. It was nothing but
mumbling when it passed through
this room." He looked at Dr.
Shalt for confirmation.</p>

<p>"I explained that to you myself,"
said the doctor. "You could
have recited the Gettysburg Address
and we'd never have known
until it returned."</p>

<p>Crawford stared down at the
limp form of Spud hanging across
his arm. He ran a hand across
his eyes, dropped the dummy
onto the desk. Turning back to
Dr. Shalt, he began to speak in a
taut, controlled voice.</p>

<p>"Dr. Shalt, I swear to you that
was not my voice at the end. I
finished with a goodbye. The
voice that spoke after that moment
of silence was somebody
else's voice. It's up to you to find
out whose."</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd," said Dr.
Shalt, irritably. "That was <i>your</i>
voice, <i>your</i> pitch. The voice of
your dummy, Spud." He wasn't
going to be taken in by any
warped sense of humor. Robbie
Crawford was the best ventriloquist
in America. He was also
noted for his practical jokes. "An
experiment of this magnitude
shouldn't be treated so lightly,"
he added acidly.</p>

<p>"You've got to believe me!"
screamed Crawford. His voice was
choked and his pale face was
glistening with perspiration. "It
was someone else, imitating my
ventriloquist voice! I swear it was
not me!"</p>

<p>Colonel Meadows sat down
abruptly. The technician ran
from the booth and returned a
moment later with a glass of
water. Colonel Meadows motioned
for him to give it to Crawford.</p>

<p>The ventriloquist gulped down
the water, then went over and sat
down beside the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Look," he said quietly. "I'm
not joking and I'm not out of my
head. It was a shock to hear a
voice so like my own, to hear it
threaten us, to know that it's traveling
from another world. It's
like hearing an echo that shouldn't
be."</p>

<p>The Colonel exchanged a puzzled
look with Dr. Shalt. After a
moment the doctor reached down
and picked the dummy up and
brought it to Crawford.</p>

<p>"Crawford, listen to me." His
voice was gentle, sympathetic.
"Perhaps you've been working
too hard. These USO trips, the
rehearsal, the excitement of the
last hour. Maybe you forgot what
you said, or said more than you
recall."</p>

<p>"I remember everything I said,"
Crawford said quietly. "I stopped
when you gave me the signal.
That voice came after I stopped.
Can't you check&mdash;?"</p>

<p>A phone in the back of the
control booth rang sharply and
Colonel Meadows answered it.
He spoke for a few moments,
then hung up. "That was the
stage manager calling from the
main auditorium. You've got ten
minutes before the show. How do
you feel?"</p>

<p>Crawford blinked in surprise.
He had almost forgotten the program.
He tried to rise, found his
legs trembling.</p>

<p>"He's in no condition to put
on a show," said Dr. Shalt. "Better
postpone it."</p>

<p>"No, no, I'm okay," protested
Crawford, walking around the
small floor, exercising his hands.
"It's my show. They're waiting
for me. Let's get going."</p>

<p>In the car, during the ride to
the auditorium, he did not speak.
He sat with Spud resting snugly
against his chest, drumming his
fingers on an arm rest while
Colonel Meadows and Dr. Shalt
talked, tried to convince him of
the invalidity in his reasoning.
There was a simple explanation
for the voice; either he had forgotten
part of his speech or maybe
some amateur radio ham had
somehow managed to pick up
their signal and was playing a
joke. He was too intelligent a
man to be frightened by such
coincidence. They spoke to him
reassuringly all during the ride.
At the stage door he thanked
them, then went inside the auditorium
to give his performance.</p>

<p>The ovation that greeted him
was tremendous. The orchestra
played his theme and an army announcer
introduced him as the
Number One ventriloquist in the
world. He walked out slowly
from the wing, waving and grinning
at the audience with Spud
sitting erect on his arm.</p>

<p>The soldiers roared and
whistled as Spud's head spun,
drooped and tilted in the opening
routine that he was famous for.
Crawford stopped in the middle
of the stage, rested his foot on a
chair that had been provided, sat
Spud on his knee. The applause
dwindled gradually and the other
members of the cast moved into
their positions. The army announcer
walked forward to engage
Crawford in conversation&mdash;to
feed him questions that would
be answered in Spud's high,
squeaky voice.</p>

<p>"Hi, Robbie, Spud," said the
announcer. "What took you so
long getting here?"</p>

<p>It was Spud's answer. All eyes
focused on the dummy's face as
it bent forward and its mouth
opened slowly. A wooden hand
moved up and scratched a wooden
head. But only a gurgle came out
of the open mouth!</p>

<p>The announcer looked at
Crawford, motioned him to speed
up. "Speak up, Spud. Can't hear
a word you're saying. No time
to be bashful."</p>

<p>Again the dummy's mouth
opened, the head bobbed and the
eyes blinked. The gurgle became
a half-strangled gasp. It whined
unsteadily a few moments then
broke off completely. The cast
in the wings began to stir nervously.
Crawford was obviously
straining. A vein throbbed in the
center of his forehead and his
lips were tight over his teeth.</p>

<p>"Stage fright," he said in an
aside to the audience. Turning
his head aside, he coughed and
cleared his throat and pretended
to whisper with Spud. "Speak
up, Pal. This is what we rehearsed
for."</p>

<p>The mouth of the dummy
flapped up and down without
cadence. The soldiers snickered,
squirmed restlessly. A sound
started, a low, plaintive wail that
broke into a dirge and finally into
a wild shriek from Crawford's
lips. He screamed and kicked
over the chair his foot was
balanced on. The dummy toppled
to the floor.</p>

<p>"I can't! I can't! My voice is
gone!" He was screaming and
clutching at his throat, trying to
loosen his collar. The curtains
closed behind him as soldiers
leaped to their feet all over the
auditorium.</p>

<p>He screamed, "I've lost my
second voice! They took it from
me! The Martians stole my
voice!"</p>

<p>The announcer grabbed his
arms then and tried to lead him
from the stage. Crawford shoved
him away.</p>

<p>"They took it," cried Crawford.
"No matter what they tell
you, the Martians took Spud's
voice. It fitted their frequency.
They'll use it to reach Earth! I
can't get it back!"</p>

<p>Colonel Meadows and several
MPs who were stationed in the
wings came out and dragged him
from the platform.</p>

<p>The G.I. audience remained
silent a moment longer, then
broke into loud, nervous rumbling.
Seconds later Colonel
Meadows returned to the microphone
and held up his hand until
the confusion died down. He
explained briefly about Dr. Shalt's
experiment and how Crawford
had been asked to participate.
He told how a human voice had
been sent to Mars for the first
time and how Crawford had
suffered a temporary shock on
hearing his voice return from this
journey.</p>

<p>He assured the audience that
Crawford would receive the best
medical care and would probably
be back performing at the field
in a few short weeks. He asked
the soldiers to remain in their
seats and let the show continue
out of respect for a great performer.</p>

<p>The orchestra began the refrain
of a popular song and the
guest vocalist appeared wearing
a white strapless evening gown.
She blew warm, friendly kisses to
the soldiers. The response she
received was a healthy one.</p>

<p>And the show went on....</p>
